# Ruby Knights Travails

Very confused on what to do. Its like I have been thrown in to the cold water.
Going to try and just push buttons and see what works.

Asked for help from discord and got an idea. I make a tree of all possible moves and do a BFS until I find the coordinate which was given.

Turns out the method I used to find the shortest path is ineffective and just waits until a certain node in the queue is at the desired location.
