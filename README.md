# Ruby Knights Travails

Very confused on what to do. Its like I have been thrown in to the cold water.
Going to try and just push buttons and see what works.

Asked for help from discord and got an idea. I make a tree of all possible moves and do a BFS until I find the coordinate which was given.

Turns out the method I used to find the shortest path is ineffective and just waits until a certain node in the queue is at the desired location.  

Turns out AGAIN that it was right, I just made some mistakes in 2-3 lines so its all fine now. This project really pushed me, but I'm very glad how it turned out.
